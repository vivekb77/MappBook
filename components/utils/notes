Checks for map page
Yes, this code looks good and includes all the important improvements we discussed. Here's a checklist of what makes it solid:
✅ Proper cleanup with comprehensive teardown of map instance, event listeners, and animations
✅ Improved style switching with viewport preservation and terrain handling
✅ Better error handling with user-friendly messages
✅ Proper type definitions for all interfaces and events
✅ Efficient animation handling with proper ref management
✅ Proper tracking of map instance and event listeners
✅ Accessibility attributes for better user experience
✅ Proper performance optimizations with React.memo
✅ Proper state management for loading, errors, and map status
✅ Proper handling of user interactions and rotation
A few things worth noting about the implementation:

The timeout for style loading is set to 5000ms, which should be sufficient
The cleanup function is comprehensive and handles all edge cases
The terrain handling is properly implemented with the DEM source
Event listeners are properly tracked and cleaned up
The rotation animation is smooth and handles state transitions well

If you want to make any further improvements, you could consider:

Adding a retry mechanism for failed style loads
Adding loading state during style switches
Adding error boundary for the component
Adding performance monitoring for animations

But these would be enhancements rather than necessary fixes. The current implementation is solid and production-ready.

Consider implementing a fallback style if the primary style fails to load
Add error boundary around the map component
Implement local storage caching of the last successful style
Add network connection status monitoring

keep an eye on reuseMaps = true or false , this can reduce mapbox usage

Check query perf with

 const startTime = performance.now()

        const { data, error: supabaseError } = await supabase
          .from('public_user_profiles')
          .select('mappbook_user_id, display_name, is_premium_user, map_style, map_views_left, country_fill_color')
          .eq('mappbook_user_id', userId)
          .single()

const endTime = performance.now()          
console.log(`Supabase query took ${endTime - startTime}ms`)
